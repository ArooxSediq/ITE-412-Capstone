# ITE-412-Capstone
<h3> Exam Scheduling Assitant </h3>

# Introduction/Overview
Creating an exam schedule is no easy task, especially in the real world
where you have unpredictable situations for instance a student taking CSC101 and
ITE412 together, or CIV102 and CIV101 together, these might be okay in the
perspective of the student but for the person designing the exam schedule it creates
conflicts which results in students having several exams in a day. It’s not an easy
task to accommodate every student so they can all have one exam per day during
finals week.
This is the issue/problem that AUIS’s registration department faces, students
always complain about having multiple exams & We all know how frustrating it
can be to have several exams in one day. Each semester the registration office goes
through many hours, days & weeks just to come up with a schedule that satisfies
all the undergraduate students.
In this project, I will be providing a solution for this problem, which is a web
based application. This application will fetch all the necessary information and
dynamically notify the user “Registration office” whenever the problem of having
multiple exams occur, the application will provide all the necessary information to
the user so they can make critical decisions based on them.

# Project Type
Development, Industry based.

# Aim
Reducing the number of students that have more than one exam a day.

# Objectives
1. Assisting the registration office in organizing exam schedule.
2. Determine the number of students that have multiple exams based on
the current schedule.
3. Provide meaningful information and feedback on the schedule in
relation to the students.
4. Creating an interactive interface where the user can drag and drop to
easily modify the schedule.
5. Giving suggestions based on the data on how to organise the current
schedule.
